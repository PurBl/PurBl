Hi, I'm PurBl
I'm a full-stack developer who cares about more than just writing code. I focus on turning messy business problems into clean, fast, and actually usable digital products. If a solution isn't scalable or maintainable, I don't consider the job done.
I build digital products that don't just look good on a landing page but actually hold up under pressure. I’m a Full-stack Developer who believes that performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

My Tech Stack
I don't believe in using tools just because they're trendy. I choose my stack based on performance and long-term stability:
My Approach
No Hype, Just Stability: I pick my stack (React/Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL) based on what will remain maintainable three years from now, not what’s trending today.

Frontend: My daily drivers are React.js and Next.js. I use TypeScript to keep things bug-free and Tailwind CSS to build interfaces that don't just look good, but work fast.
Infrastructure Matters: I need to know exactly where my code lives. Whether it’s running on Docker, AWS, or Vercel, I’m the one who put it there and ensured it stays up.

Backend & Data: I build system architectures with Node.js and Python, handling data modeling through PostgreSQL and Supabase.
Refactoring as a Craft: I focus on reducing technical debt before it becomes a business problem. I enjoy turning messy codebases into predictable, type-safe systems using TypeScript.

DevOps & Tools: I like knowing exactly where my code lives. I handle my own deployments and containerization using Docker, AWS, and Vercel.
Current Focus
I’m currently building open-source tools and losing sleep over distributed systems. There’s something strangely satisfying about managing real-time data at scale and solving the consistency issues that come with it.

What I Bring to the Table
End-to-End SaaS Development: I don't just build features; I build living systems for startups that need to scale.

Smart Automation: If a task is repetitive, I automate it. I write custom scripts and API integrations to save time and reduce human error.

Performance & Refactoring: I enjoy taking slow, "spaghetti" codebases and cleaning them up to improve both speed and the developer experience.

What's On My Mind Lately
Right now, I’m building open-source business tools and diving deep into distributed systems. There's something incredibly satisfying about managing the chaos of real-time data processing at scale—handling millions of data points in milliseconds is what keeps me sharp.
